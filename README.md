# IoTBrailleEmulation
This is an emulation of hardware for 3d printed Braille Display that can controll IoT devices. This is a stand in for the lacking hardware for our demo.
Overall the code uses LED's to display braille, a speaker to differentiate between letters and numbers ,a keypad to represent the perkins keyboard input, a rotarty encoder for numeric input.
